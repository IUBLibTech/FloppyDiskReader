## 3d Printed Parts

There are some things that are either very hard to find or are custom to this 
project.  The filament total is less than 1Kg so the materials price is less 
than $20.  However, the price for printing varies.  In our case it'll be $0 
because I'll print it on my printers, but if others were to replicate this, 
it might have a cost.

The bulkhead adapter and greaseweazle tray were designed in FreeCAD and if
different dimensions are needed the values in the spreadsheet in the model
files can be adjusted.


* Drive Blank (2x)
  
  Needed to cover the holes in the unused bays of the case
